Hi, my dear friends.
It’s warm out today.
People say that there is no bad weather.
At any time of year the weather makes us happy with her gifts. 
I would like to tell you about the fall, because there is nothing better, than the autumn weather.
There is something sad in the fall, but at the same time romantic.
Autumn — is the perfect time to stroll and relax.
